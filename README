some basic ceph utils.

pool_info:

this is an alternative "ceph df" - it essentially does the same thing but i've added a column to display how much of their quota is used. you'll need admin level privilages to read the quota attribute from each pool. try this on a monitor. 

osd_variance:

this script will print the highest and lowest variance OSDs in your cluster, useful for finding disks which are not filling evenly. use "ceph osd crush reweight {name} {weight}" or "ceph osd reweight-by-utilization {threshold}" to 
correct large variances.
